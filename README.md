# Node Algorithms
High level goals–

–Create a server using vanilla node
–Serve a page that reimplements JSON.stringify()
–Serve a page that implements a library with shelves, books, and authors

# Step by Step
Below are low level descriptions of the high level goals.

### Create a server using vanilla node
Your goal here is to create a server that you can run via command line.

Download and install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Do this via the node site or with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

–Use only vanilla node
–Do not use NPM or NPM packages
–Serve a distribution directory that contains the rest of the assignment
–Account for HTML, JS, and CSS
–Serve a 404 page if the dist directory's contents aren't found

### Serve a page that reimplements JSON.stringify()
The goal of this is to recreate `JSON.stringify()` without using `JSON.stringify()`.

–Don't use `toString()` or `JSON.stringify()`
–Have some kind of input on the page so a user can enter in a param
–Have the output displayed
–Have the same function accessible via console
-Account for input of any type

### Serve a page that implements a library with shelves, books, and authors
Finally you need to build a library.  This library needs to be able to be searched, iterated through, and added to.

–This has to be an object
–This object contains shelves, which contain books, which have an author and a title
–The library needs methods to add and remove shelves
–The shelves should have methods to add and remove books
–A user should be able to add shelves and books to this library through a UI
–A user should also be able to do this via console
–A user should always be able to see what's contained in the library both through the console and UI

### General
All front end views should be styled.  Use skeleton this time.
